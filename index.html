        <article class="about-par">
            <p>As with many of people around the world, I spend a lot of my time on the web. But thats not really accurate any longer because no one says they are hanging out on the web. They say their on Facebook, Discord, Undercity (WOW), or Forgotten City (Second Life). Even watching TV is now an online. We have places now that we go, the web has become second nature to our communication it is community. The web is continually growing and as there are more and more places being developed on the web for people to go. We are continually  migrating there. </p> 

            <p>This is what I want to be a part of as a web developer. I want to make some contribution to our changing virtual world.  I want to be part of the Oasis &#128521;.</p>
                
                
            <p>Offline I am obsessed with my dog, Hiccup! I live in the PNW  and enjoy the wonderful summers here. I love to learn online or offline I believe that learning is an everyday thing and I never go to bed the same person that I was when I woke.
